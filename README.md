**Sentiment Influence on Technology Stocks from Reddit Discussions**


**Introduction**
"Once in a while, technology comes along that is so powerful and so broadly applicable that it accelerates the normal march of economic progress." – Andrew McAfee. 
In the era of rapid technological advancements, social media platforms like Reddit have become crucial indicators of public sentiment, significantly influencing various sectors, including the financial market. This project aims to analyze sentiments on Reddit and assess their impact on the stock prices of leading technology companies.

**Background**
The digital age has transformed technology into a primary driver of economic growth. Reddit, known for its vibrant and community-driven content, hosts discussions that range widely, from everyday topics to specialized technological subjects. Understanding the discourse surrounding tech companies on Reddit is essential for investors, analysts, and the companies themselves, as it can significantly influence stock market activity.

Our focus is on Reddit’s active subreddits such as r/Technology, r/Futurology, and r/News, where technology enthusiasts and the general public discuss the latest technological advancements. By analyzing sentiments within these discussions, we aim to uncover the relationship between public opinion and stock market trends of prominent tech firms like Microsoft, Nvidia, Adobe, Alphabet, and Amazon.

**Project Scope**
Using advanced data analytics techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and sentiment analysis, combined with cloud computing resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), this project processes and analyzes vast amounts of Reddit data to explore the potential impacts of public sentiment on stock prices.
